= DNP3

OpenPLC supports running as a DNP3 outstation (server) using the OpenDNP3 library
provided by Automatak. This chaper covers how to configure DNP3 support in OpenPLC
and ends with an example program to test things out yourself.

IMPORTANT: DNP3 is not implemented on the Windows platform.

== DNP3 Basics

DNP3 is a robust communication protocol often used where a device is to be monitored
or controlled by a master. The protocol is commonly usedb by electric and water utilities.
DNP3's integrity is achieved through extensive use of cyclic redundancy check codes and

DNP3 is primarily concerned with data points. Each data point is describe by a type and
